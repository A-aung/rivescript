RiveScript is a simple scripting language for programming chatbots. It is
available as a development library for many programming languages, allowing
chatbot developers to create their own bots from scratch and program its
replies using an easy-to-learn syntax.

This repository, `github.com/aichaos/rivescript`, serves as an entry point for
users new to RiveScript and provides useful links to related projects. It also
hosts the [Community RiveScript Wiki](https://github.com/aichaos/rivescript/wiki).

# Learn RiveScript

First, check out the RiveScript official website for a general overview and
background on RiveScript: <https://www.rivescript.com/>

There is a tutorial for the RiveScript language available at
<https://www.rivescript.com/docs/tutorial>

# RiveScript Specification

The language specification is called the "RiveScript Working Draft" and
describes how the scripting language *should* work, from an implementation
agnostic point of view. It's a great reference for those new to the language
to see all the possible commands and tags that the language supports.

It's also useful for developers who want to program their own implementation
of the RiveScript language.

The Working Draft is hosted on GitHub at
<https://github.com/aichaos/rivescript-wd>

# Implementations

The AiChaos organization on GitHub oversees the following **five primary
implementations** of RiveScript:

* [Go](https://github.com/aichaos/rivescript-go)
* [Java](https://github.com/aichaos/rivescript-java)
* [JavaScript](https://github.com/aichaos/rivescript-js)
* [Perl](https://github.com/aichaos/rivescript-perl)
* [Python](https://github.com/aichaos/rivescript-python)

Click any of the above links to be taken to the project page for the RiveScript
implementation in that programming language. The primary implementations are
all released under the MIT License; see each repository for details.

There are some third-party implementations in other programming languages,
such as PHP and C#, with links at the following locations:

* [Interpreters on RiveScript.com](https://www.rivescript.com/interpreters)
* [On the Awesome RiveScript Repo](https://github.com/aichaos/awesome-rivescript)

# Community

## The RiveScript Wiki

[The RiveScript Wiki](https://github.com/aichaos/rivescript/wiki) on GitHub
is where the RiveScript community can post snippets, code samples and ideas
for general RiveScript bots and things you can do with them.

Examples that are for one programming language or another (for example, a
Slack bot written in JavaScript that uses `rivescript-js`) would be found on
that programming language's project page (e.g., `rivescript-js`).

The wiki on *this* GitHub repo is for general purpose RiveScript examples.

## Gitter Chat

There are chat rooms for RiveScript and some of its projects available on
Gitter at <https://gitter.im/aichaos>.

## Botmakers Slack

There is a `#rivescript` channel on the [Botmakers Slack](https://botmakers.org/)
organization. You can join the Botmakers Slack at <https://botmakers.org/>
